# windows7-x86
到了2023年，還是有需要用到 windows7 x86 的時候

##### Q: What is the latest version of jdk that is compatible with win7 sp1 x86?
```
A: The latest version of the Java Development Kit (JDK) that is compatible with Windows 7 SP1 32-bit is JDK 8u281. This version of JDK 8 is the last one that Oracle released with public updates for commercial use, and it was released on January 19, 2021.

Note that Microsoft has ended support for Windows 7 on January 14, 2020, which means that there will be no more security updates or technical support from Microsoft for this operating system. It is strongly recommended to upgrade to a supported operating system to ensure your computer's security and stability.
