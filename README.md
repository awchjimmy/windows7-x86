### Q: When did Microsoft end mainstream support for Windows 7?

A: Microsoft ended mainstream support for Windows 7 on January 13, 2015, but extended support for the operating system continued until January 14, 2020. This means that Windows 7 x86 (32-bit) also reached the end of its extended support on that same date. After this date, Microsoft stopped providing security updates and technical support for Windows 7 x86, which may make it more vulnerable to security threats and issues. It is recommended that users upgrade to a newer operating system to ensure that their systems remain secure and functional.


### Q: What is the latest version of jdk that is compatible with win7 sp1 x86?

Note that Microsoft has ended support for Windows 7 on January 14, 2020, which means that there will be no more security updates or technical support from Microsoft for this operating system.
